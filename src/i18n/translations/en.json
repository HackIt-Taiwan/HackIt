    "introduction": "HackIt is Taiwan's first teen-led creative community. We organize our own events, write our own code, and make our own impact. Rejecting rote learning and passive waiting, HackIt empowers every teenager to build their own future.",
    "founderStoryTitle": "Our <highlight>Origin Story</highlight>",
    "founderStoryTitlePlain": "Origin Story",
    "founderStoryParagraph1": "HackIt was born in 2024, started by four high school students. After being invited to a global Hack Club hackathon, we challenged ourselves to create Taiwan's first-ever teen-organized hackathon. No one knew if it would work, but we believed that without trying, we'd never find out.",
    "founderStoryParagraph2": "We refuse to let youth be defined by exams and textbooks alone. Through action, we prove that creativity and adventure aren't limited by age. From initial chaos to growing competence, we showed Taiwan that even a group of high schoolers can host impactful, inspiring events. HackIt became our gentle yet powerful challenge to the educational system.",
    "founderStoryParagraph3": "When creativity becomes routine, HackIt transforms from an event into an attitude—a youth culture of curiosity, courage, and collaboration. We've seen participants find direction here, feel understood, and realize for the first time: 'I too can change something.' HackIt doesn't just offer a stage, but a place where teens regain confidence in themselves. We witness firsthand: when young people are truly believed in, they create possibilities adults can't even imagine. Learning should never be confined to the classroom.",
    "coreValuesTitle": "Our <highlight>Core Values</highlight>",
    "coreValueInnovativeTitle": "Challenge Convention",
    "coreValueInnovativeDescription": "We reject the mindset of 'it's always been this way.' Encouraging innovation, questioning norms, and redefining what truly matters in learning.",
    "coreValueCommunityTitle": "Embrace Adventure",
    "coreValueCommunityDescription": "Every day deserves a step outside your comfort zone. True growth comes from trying what scares yet excites you. We're here to stumble, laugh, and fly together.",
    "coreValuePracticalTitle": "Believe in Yourself",
    "coreValuePracticalDescription": "You don't need to meet others' standards of 'excellence'; you're strongest as yourself. We believe everyone has a spark waiting to be seen, needing only a place to ignite.",
    "coreValueLifelongLearningTitle": "Hands-On Action",
